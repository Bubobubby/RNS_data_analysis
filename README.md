# RNS_data_analysis

I use data from website radio Nowy Åšwiat to analyze the list of songs,artists and type of music . I started this project for practice my new knowledge about data analysis


Project still in progress. I would like  merge playlist with data from spotify. Data spotify is much bigger and instead of genre and country has more variables like beats per minute, energy, danceability, loudness,liveness and valence

Currently in project you will find simple results like the most views artist, songs, country and genre compare with audition redactors
